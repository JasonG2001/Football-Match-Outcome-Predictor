# Milestone 2

Milestone 2 introduces the beginning of analysing data through the perspective of a data scientist.Through observing the results provided, I have written a python class which could gather different types of information from the results.
Examples involve retrieving the number of wins per year from each league:

getting the winner of a match between two teams, given the league and year where the game took place.

getting the leaderboard of wins from each team in the form of a dictionary for each year.

From my report, I have suggested some hypothesis regarding which statistics I think will be most important to consider when making the football predictor. One of which I think will have the biggest influence is the number of wins each team has from each year. The more recent the wins, the more weight they will likely have as their teams will still be similar with very few changes.
